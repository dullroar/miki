<!--
This is a comment, and will not show up as visible on a generated page.
It will show up as an html comment, and you can see it if you
View Source or edit the html file.
Markdown doesn't have comments, but it does let you add
html directly to your .md files.
So this is an html comment.

# What is this?

This is a basic Markdown (md) starter file
for consistently starting any new md Miki page.
You can copy `mdStarter.md` to a new file anywhere in your wiki,
and start editing.
Use it or don't.

# And what is *this*?

This is a gratuitous second section,
to make it more obvious that there's a table of contents at the top.

Note that [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) doesn't actually have a table of contents feature.
Miki's `makefile` uses `pandoc` to generate md to html files.
I use `pandoc's --toc` argument; it's `pandoc` that generates the TOC.
