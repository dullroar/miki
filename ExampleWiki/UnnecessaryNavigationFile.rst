This is a typical wiki navigation page.

In miki, pages like this are really unnecessary,
and I (a3n) don't use one.
Just use the navigation features of your browser.
The file is here as an example, in case you really want a nav page.

The problem with navigation pages,
particularly in a minimal no-software wiki like miki,
is that if you move files and directories around
(like TopicA and TopicX below),
you then have to go around repairing links.

That's not to say that you shouldn't have links in your miki pages.
I link to my books (also in my miki),
other miki pages where it's relevant to the topic,
and of course web links.

A navigation page has a list of links that you can click on,
and you have to maintain it.

A browser directory listing has a list of links that you can click on,
and it's always automatically up to date.

Go to `Topic A <$MWK/TopicA/topicA.rst>`__.

Go to `Topic X rst file <$MWK/TopicX/rstTopicX.rst>`__.

Go to `Topic X md file <$MWK/TopicX/mdTopicX.md>`__.
