Everything there is to know about Topic A
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is a link to a file in the miki Books directory:
`Wilhelm Scream <$MWK/Books/Wilhelm/WilhelmScream.mp3>`__

I actually have this in my personal use of Miki,
but here in the the example I did not include the binary,
so that link is dead.

Here is a link to the meta.json file in that directory,
which includes a source link to archive.org,
in case you want to listen to Private Wilhelm perform his
famous scream. $MWK/Books/Wilhelm/meta.json
