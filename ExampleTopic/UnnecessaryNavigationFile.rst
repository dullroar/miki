Example Topic Unnecessary Navigation Page
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is a typical wiki navigation page.
It does nothing but direct you to other pages.
Which is fine, but you could just use
your browser's ability to navigate directories;
that's what I do in my wiki.

Go to `ExampleTopic's directory <$MWK/ExampleTopic/>`__,
and do your navigating from there.
You almost never have to write a purely navigational page.
The file system and the browser handle 90% of your navigation needs.
It's not pretty, but it's functional, and you don't have to maintain it.

Or, if you must, ...

This file is here as an example, in case you really want a nav page.

| Go to `Topic A page <$MWK/ExampleTopic/TopicA/topicA.rst>`__.
| Demo of a topic page with a link to a media file.

| Go to `Topix X directory/top <$MWK/ExampleTopic/TopicX/>`__
| A topic with pages that link to each other, and back to here.

Go directly to
`Topic X adoc-based page <$MWK/ExampleTopic/TopicX/adocTopicX.adoc>`__.

Go directly to
`Topic X md-based page <$MWK/ExampleTopic/TopicX/mdTopicX.md>`__.

Go directly to
`Topic X rst-based page <$MWK/ExampleTopic/TopicX/rstTopicX.rst>`__.
