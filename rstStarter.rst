.. This is a comment, and will not show up as visible on a generated page.
   It will show up as an html comment, and you can see it if you
   View Source or edit the html file.
   A comment is a directive leader without a directive, just text.

What is this?
=============

This is a basic reStructuredText (rst) starter file
for consistently starting any new rst Miki page.
You can copy ``rstStarter.rst`` to a new file anywhere in your wiki,
and start editing.
Use it or don't.

And what is *this*?
===================

This is a gratuitous second section,
to make it more obvious that there's a table of contents at the top.

Note that
`reStructuredText 
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html>`__
`does` have syntax for a table of contents. View ``rstStarter.rst`` to see how it's done.
